## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- 00b74e9: Run the release train so the stranded 0.17.0 reaches npm and the recovery path
  gets exercised on a real release.

  No package source changed in this PR — the fixes are the Tag visual baselines
  and `release.yml`'s new `Publish any stranded versions` step. But `release.yml`
  only triggers on pushes that touch `.changeset/**`, so without a changeset
  merging it would not start a release at all, and the step meant to unstrand
  0.17.0 would sit unverified until some unrelated changeset happened to land.

  Bumping the whole published set matches the 2026-08-11 changeset it lands
  beside: npm is behind `main` on every package, not just the ones whose source
  moved, and a partial bump would leave the rest still disagreeing.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- 3fcf3f1: Bump every published package so the next release run publishes the whole set.

  The 0.17.0 bump landed on `main` but never reached npm: the release job's build
  died inside `changesets/action` with `Failed to spawn process: Resource
temporarily unavailable (os error 11)` — an `EAGAIN` write to that action's
  stdout pipe, not a build failure. This changeset re-cuts the whole set on top of
  the workflow fix, so every package publishes from a release that runs its build
  in a runner-owned step.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 66b251d: Bump every published package so the next release run publishes the whole set.
  Packages that carried no substantive change of their own have fallen behind the
  rest of the workspace; this gives each of them a real new version so the
  published set stays in lockstep.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 97da94e: Repair the two CI gates failing on `main`, and refresh the generated registry artifacts.

  No package's runtime code changes here — every bump in this release is version-only.

  **`drift`** — `clientJs` reached the component manifests, but the 103 generated
  per-component files under `apps/site/public/r/` came from a branch cut before it, so merging
  the two left every one of them a field short. Regenerated; no other artifact moved.

  **`verify`** — `isolated:check`, the canary that type-checks packed tarballs in a strict,
  non-hoisted consumer workspace, was dying in `pnpm install` rather than in the type check it
  exists to run:

  ```
  ERR_PNPM_NO_MATCHING_VERSION  No matching version found for
  @cascivo/core@^0.15.0 while fetching it from https://registry.npmjs.org/
  ```

  `pnpm pack` rewrites `workspace:^` to `^<version>`, so the packed `@cascivo/react` asked the
  registry for a version that does not exist until release day — the fixture broke on every
  version bump that landed ahead of a publish, which is exactly what happened. Every
  inter-cascivo edge is now pinned to the tarball built from the commit under test, via
  `overrides` in the fixture's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. The location matters: pnpm 10+ no longer
  reads the `pnpm` field from `package.json` and only warns about it, so the `pnpm.overrides`
  spelling silently does nothing.

  That also closes a quieter hole. Even when the versions did resolve, the fixture type-checked
  the freshly-built `@cascivo/react` against the last **published** `@cascivo/core` rather than
  the one just built — a mix, not the build under test.

  A new guard fails the fixture if any `@cascivo/*` dependency falls outside its `PACKAGES`
  list, since such an edge would slip back to registry resolution unnoticed — the silent-skip
  failure mode a canary must never have.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 4172611: Bump every published package so the next release run publishes the whole set. The
  release drift gate had been failing on non-reproducible `regen` output (see PR #179),
  so packages carrying no substantive change of their own were left behind at versions
  older than the rest of the workspace. This changeset gives each of them a real new
  version, keeping the published set in lockstep.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- dfc24e4: Documentation updates
- db4fa0d: Docs

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 0b6b44e: Force a version bump across every published package to verify the changesets
  publish patch fix (see the release workflow fix in PR #168): several packages
  had been stuck re-publishing their already-released version on every release
  run and failing with a spurious E403, because the "already published" error
  detection missed pnpm's actual error shape. This changeset gives every
  package a real new version so the next release run exercises a genuine
  publish for all of them, not just the ones with substantive changes.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 958fd6f: Every published package now exports `./package.json`, so
  `require.resolve('@cascivo/<pkg>/package.json')` resolves instead of throwing
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. Previously only `@cascivo/react` exposed it, which
  tripped version probes, bundler plugins, and inspection tooling on the other packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2945720: Adopter-friction fixes (TanStack Start / Vite SSR report):

  - **vite-plugin:** new `cascivoSsr()` plugin sets `ssr.noExternal` for every
    `@cascivo/*` package, so Vite SSR / TanStack Start / workerd no longer throw
    `Unknown file extension ".css"`. See docs/USING-WITH-VITE-SSR.md.
  - **registry:** page blocks are now projected into `/r/<name>.json` and
    `/r/shadcn/block-<name>.json` (was: components only), so blocks install via the
    shadcn CLI and appear in every machine-readable surface.
  - **mcp:** new `search_icons` tool resolves an icon by intent or foreign name
    (LayoutDashboard→Dashboard, Rocket→Spaceship), backed by the icon catalog.
  - **icons:** added `GitBranch`/`GitCommit`/`GitMerge`/`GitPullRequest`, plus an
    alias layer so familiar Lucide/Radix names resolve to the cascivo export
    (surfaced as an `aliases` field in icons.catalog.json).
  - **charts:** area-chart solid-fill opacity is now the `--cascivo-chart-fill-opacity`
    token (default 0.25), raised on dark themes so fills keep their hue instead of
    muddying into the dark surface.
  - **themes:** new `--cascivo-chart-fill-opacity` token (0.4 on dark-surface themes,
    0.25 elsewhere).
