Adoption-audit fixes (waves 1–2):

- CLI: per-command `--help` for every command (short-circuits before any prompt, fetch, or install); real `--version` (was hardcoded `0.0.0`); `init --theme <name>` / `--yes` with non-TTY defaulting; theme prompts and `theme add` now offer all 12 themes; `add` prints the `@cascivo/themes` wiring when the project doesn't import tokens yet; `add` is transactional (fetch-all-then-write — a failed fetch never leaves a partial component or a stale lockfile entry) and mixed bare + registry specs install both; registry fetches retry with backoff and fall back to the last cached copy when offline; first-party templates (`dashboard`, `auth`, `landing`) install by bare name; `@cascivo/<name>` namespace added (`@cascade/<name>` remains as a legacy alias); `doctor` no longer false-positives on hook names in comments; lockfile renamed `cascade.lock` → `cascivo.lock` (legacy file read and migrated automatically); HTTP cache moved to `~/.cascivo/cache`.
- Registry: entries carry the real library version and per-file sha256 hashes; `cascivo update --check` diffs hashes instead of the previously inert version compare.
- MCP: real server version (was `0.0.0`); `cascivo-mcp` bin added (`cascade-mcp` kept as a legacy alias).
- i18n/react: `Combobox` search input, `DataTable` pagination buttons, `Dock` nav, and `Steps` list now source their aria-labels from the built-in catalog (with `labels`/`ariaLabel` prop overrides) instead of hardcoded English.
