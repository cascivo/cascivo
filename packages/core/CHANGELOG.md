### Minor Changes

- 6f318dd: Fix the 2026-07-26 adopter pair — two same-day dashboard reports on published 0.12.0.

  **The manifest's prose now reaches the shipped `.d.ts`.** Two agents built the same dashboard
  against the same version; the one who read `llms.txt` was saved by the ⚠ on `Flex`'s
  `direction` default, the one who read `@cascivo/react/dist/index.d.ts` hit it three times.
  `pnpm regen` now republishes every documented default and warning as TSDoc on the TypeScript
  member (124 components), and `tsdoc-parity` fails a PR that lets the two drift.

  **Router links have a supported styling path.** `Link` gains `asChild`, so an in-content
  router link can carry cascivo's styling without a hand-rolled copy of its CSS.
  `Button`/`IconButton`/`Item`/`Tile` set `text-decoration: none` (the UA anchor underline
  survived onto `asChild` buttons) and style `[aria-disabled='true']` like `:disabled` (an `<a>`
  can never match `:disabled`). `--cascivo-link-color` is now a declared, catalogued token.
  New guide: `docs/USING-WITH-A-ROUTER.md`.

  **`cascivo audit --ai` no longer fails correct code.** Four independent root causes: duplicate
  display names collapsing in the contract (`AppShell`, `Calendar`), `children` being looked for
  as an attribute, `required` drift the manifests were never checked for, and aliased imports
  resolving to the pre-`as` name (so a router's `<Link to>` was audited against cascivo's
  contract). A realistic router dashboard is now audited in CI and must report zero errors.

  **Charts: axis chrome and `ComboChart`.** `Axis` gains `orientation="y-right"` — a right axis
  used to draw its labels inside the plot. `rightMarginForLabels` reserves room for a right axis
  and for the final x-label's overhang (`7/26/2026` → `7/26/202`). `ComboChart` now sizes its
  margins, strides crowded category labels, ships a legend, includes the line series in its
  screen-reader table (a WCAG 2.2-AA defect), and warns on index-misaligned or wildly-mismatched
  series. Overlapping `AreaChart` fills drop opacity so the plot stops contradicting its legend.
  Every chart's `width` prop now documents that **omitting it** is the responsive mode.

  **One vocabulary for status and progress.** `Tone` (`neutral | info | success | warning |
danger`) and `Progress` (`pending | active | complete | error`) in `@cascivo/core`; `Badge`,
  `Tag`, `Status`, `Notification`, `Steps` and `Timeline` accept them plus every historical
  spelling. `Filter`/`StructuredList`/`Progress` accept `ariaLabel` alongside `aria-label`;
  `OverflowMenu` items accept `id` alongside `value`. All additive.

  **Also:** `Card padding="none"` no longer strips padding from `CardHeader`/`CardContent`;
  11 field components and the chart frame shrink correctly inside a grid/flex track; `Kpi`'s
  chrome moved from inline styles into a layered stylesheet (it was un-overridable);
  `Stat` gains `card` so it matches `Kpi`; `AppShell` extends `HTMLAttributes` so its documented
  tokens have an application point; `PieChart` gains `tooltip`; `DataTable` only uses a fixed
  layout when every column is sized, and gains `Column.minWidth`; `PageHeader` is exported.

  **Card padding no longer doubles.** A card and its `CardHeader`/`CardContent` both applied the
  padding, so a default `<Card><CardHeader>` sat its title 48px from the border. The
  subcomponents now own the inset when they are present. Found by a new computed-style canary
  that renders the shipped `dist` in headless Chromium — the class of defect (an `asChild`
  button's UA underline, a card's resolved padding) that jsdom cannot see and a stylesheet grep
  cannot prove.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 254a1a9: Fix the reactivity contract, SSR ids, and the audit's reachability (2026-07-25 adopter report)

  **`useSignal` / `useComputed` now make your component reactive.** They were raw re-exports of
  `@preact/signals-react`, so without the Babel signals transform — which no consumer app runs
  — a component reading `signal.value` in render never re-rendered. The failure was silent:
  handlers fired, signals updated, the UI froze. `docs/HEADLESS.md` had always promised these
  subscribe for you; now they do, and the promise is machine-checked rather than prose. The
  rule that survives: `useSignals()` is still required for a signal you did **not** get from a
  cascivo hook (a module-level `signal()`, a signal passed as a prop, `currentLocale()`).

  **Every reactivity primitive is now importable from `@cascivo/react`.** The prebuilt path had
  no legal move: the reactivity contract said "use `useSignal`", the SSR guide said never depend
  on `@cascivo/core`, and `useSignal` lived only in core. `useSignal`, `useComputed`,
  `useSignalEffect`, `useSignals`, `signal`, `computed`, `effect`, `batch`,
  `useControllableSignal`, `useEffectPropSignal`, `useDisclosure`, `useMachine`, `useScope`,
  `useId`, `useMediaQuery`, `useRovingFocus`, `useTypeahead`, `useAnchorPosition`,
  `DismissableLayer`, `Presence`, `Slot`, `VisuallyHidden` and more now ship from
  `@cascivo/react`. Import the `Signal`/`ReadonlySignal` **types** from `@preact/signals-react`
  (a declared peer you already have).

  **New `useEffectPropSignal`** for a controlled prop whose signal is read only inside
  `useSignalEffect`. Preact runs effects synchronously on write, so the previously documented
  `s.value = prop` idiom executed effect bodies inside React's render phase — `showModal()`,
  listener registration against a pre-commit ref, parent `setState` calls. Fourteen sites across
  `Modal`, `Sheet`, `Dropdown`, `AlertDialog`, `CommandMenu`, `HeaderPanel`, `Checkbox`,
  `Presence`, `useDraggable`, `useInfiniteScroll`, `useResizeObserver` and flow are migrated.
  `useControllableSignal` keeps its synchronous mirror, which is correct for a signal read in
  render.

  Behavioral note: effect work driven by a controlled prop now lands one microtask after the
  commit, where it always belonged. If you assert on it synchronously in a test, await the
  settle (`await act(async () => …)`).

  **`Search` and `usePopover` no longer break SSR hydration.** Both built DOM identifiers from a
  module-scoped counter that kept incrementing for the life of the server process, so it
  diverged from a freshly-loaded client on essentially every request — a mismatch React does not
  patch up, which can leave `<label for>` pointing at nothing. Both use `useId` now.

  **`cascivo audit --ai` runs in your project.** It previously searched for `apps/site/public/`,
  a directory that only exists in the cascivo monorepo, and died with "token catalog not found"
  everywhere else. The contract now ships inside the CLI (~100 KB), with `--contract <path>`,
  `--verbose`, and a cached network fallback. No setup, no network required.

  **`Kpi` gained `deltaFormat`** (`'number' | 'percent' | (delta) => string`), so a percentage
  delta renders as `+25.6%`; values are locale-formatted. **`CardHeader` gained `actions`** for
  the title-left / menu-right dashboard card, which the column default made awkward.
  **`IconButton` and `Sparkline`** now accept `ariaLabel` as an alias for `label`; exactly one
  remains required.

### Patch Changes

- 4172611: Bump every published package so the next release run publishes the whole set. The
  release drift gate had been failing on non-reproducible `regen` output (see PR #179),
  so packages carrying no substantive change of their own were left behind at versions
  older than the rest of the workspace. This changeset gives each of them a real new
  version, keeping the published set in lockstep.

- dfc24e4: Documentation updates
- db4fa0d: Docs

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 0b6b44e: Force a version bump across every published package to verify the changesets
  publish patch fix (see the release workflow fix in PR #168): several packages
  had been stuck re-publishing their already-released version on every release
  run and failing with a spurious E403, because the "already published" error
  detection missed pnpm's actual error shape. This changeset gives every
  package a real new version so the next release run exercises a genuine
  publish for all of them, not just the ones with substantive changes.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- e81a0a7: `setLinkComponent` now infers `LinkComponentProps` for an inline adapter.

  An inline router adapter like `setLinkComponent(({ href, ...rest }) => <Link to={href}
{...rest} />)` previously got no parameter types (the parameter was `ElementType`), so
  `href` was untyped — the exact seam where a router integration is most error-prone. An
  added overload contextually types an inline function adapter as `LinkComponentProps`, so
  `href` is inferred with no annotation. Every existing call still compiles (`'a'`, a
  Next.js `Link`, a class component) via the `ElementType` fallback overload.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 21e7ddb: Expose the router-link contract as a named, documented type.

  `setLinkComponent` shipped, but the prop bag it hands a custom link was an opaque
  `ElementType` — an adopter reading the shipped `.d.ts` as documentation couldn't see
  `href`/`aria-current`/`onClick`/… or the `href → to` mapping idiom (2026-07-20 report, #6).
  `@cascivo/core` now exports a JSDoc'd `LinkComponentProps` interface, re-exported from
  `@cascivo/react`, and `setLinkComponent`'s docs show the TanStack adapter inline.

  `SideNavLinkProps.onClick` is now optional: cascivo always provides it and it only
  `preventDefault`s a disabled item, so it composes cleanly when spread onto a router
  `<Link>` (which keeps middle-click / open-in-new-tab).

### Patch Changes

- 21e7ddb: Raise the `@preact/signals-react` peer floor from `>=2.0.0` to `>=3.0.0`.

  React 19 removed the internal export that signals-react 2.x imports, so a 2.x
  runtime fails to load under React 19 (`SyntaxError: … '__SECRET_INTERNALS…'`). The
  old `>=2` floor let a resolver pick that broken build. signals-react 3.x still
  supports React 16.14+/17/18, so the new floor costs React-18 users nothing.

  If a lockfile carried over from an earlier install pins signals-react 2.x, run
  `cascivo doctor` — it now flags the mismatch (error on React 19, warning on React 18)
  with the exact upgrade command.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 958fd6f: Add an optional `importSymbols` field to `ComponentMeta` so a component whose display
  `name` is not itself an export (compound/imperative modules — `SkipNav` ships
  `SkipNavLink`/`SkipNavTarget`, `Toast` ships `ToastProvider`/`useToast`) renders a
  correct `import { … }` line in its generated docs instead of a broken
  `import { SkipNav }`. Also corrects the DataTable `rows` prop description (was a
  pasted "Number of visible text rows.") and documents 26 previously-undocumented props
  across the manifests, now enforced by the props-parity Direction-B gate.
- 958fd6f: Every published package now exports `./package.json`, so
  `require.resolve('@cascivo/<pkg>/package.json')` resolves instead of throwing
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. Previously only `@cascivo/react` exposed it, which
  tripped version probes, bundler plugins, and inspection tooling on the other packages.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 357ba46: Fixes from the TanStack Start dashboard adopter report (SSR + framework integration):

  - **core:** new `setLinkComponent()` / `getLinkComponent()` (and the `LinkComponent`
    type) — register your router's `Link` once at app start so cascivo's config-driven
    nav components render real router links (preserving `href`, `aria-current`, and
    active `data-state`) instead of plain `<a>`, with no `onClick` interception. See
    docs/HEADLESS.md. Also: the signal-returning hooks `useControllableSignal`,
    `useMediaQuery`, `useDisclosure`, `useMachine`, `useRovingFocus`, `useStreamBuffer`,
    and `useScope` now call `useSignals()` internally, so a plain React consumer that
    reads their signal in render stays reactive without calling `useSignals()` itself
    (matching `useTheme`/`useForm`).
  - **react:** `SideNav`, `ShellHeader`, `Header`, `Breadcrumb`, `Switcher`, `Dock`, and
    `NavigationMenu` route their links through the registered link component (above);
    `SideNavItem.render` now receives the computed icon/label node and the anchor prop
    bag so a per-item hatch no longer discards layout. `RelativeTime` is now
    hydration-safe under SSR by default (server text is kept and corrected on the
    client) — pass a fixed `now` for byte-deterministic output.
  - **charts:** `PieChart` (and the whole trig family — donut, gauge, meter, radial-bar,
    radar, sunburst, polar) now emit quantized arc/polar coordinates, so they hydrate
    cleanly under SSR instead of throwing away the server markup on cross-engine
    floating-point differences. Also quieted the shared chart `ResizeObserver` loop.

  Note for reviewers: the responsive `Grid`/`Columns`/`SettingsLayout` container fix and
  the `Fork` → git-branch icon alias ship through the copy-paste registry (private
  `@cascivo/layouts`) and the regenerated site icon catalog respectively, so they are not
  versioned here.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 810b8ba: Minor improvements

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- dd05e9b: Add `useTypeahead` and fix duplicate-aria-id bugs in overlay components.

  - **`@cascivo/core`:** new `useTypeahead` primitive — type-to-select buffer for
    menus/listboxes. Accumulates printable keypresses, resets after an inactivity
    window, and calls `onMatch(query)` so the consumer focuses the matching item.
    Signal/ref-based, SSR-safe, no `useEffect`.
  - **Modal / Tooltip / AlertDialog:** replaced hardcoded static aria ids (Modal,
    AlertDialog) and a `Math.random()` id (Tooltip) with `useId()`. Two of the same
    component on one page no longer emit duplicate ids, so their `aria-labelledby` /
    `aria-describedby` references resolve correctly; Tooltip ids are now stable
    (SSR-safe) and colon-free (valid in the CSS anchor name).
  - **Menu:** keyboard navigation moved off per-item `nextElementSibling` walking onto
    panel-level roving focus + `useTypeahead`, so disabled items and separators are
    skipped and Home/End, arrow-wrap, and type-to-select work.

### Minor Changes

- 4554af1: Make object-valued prop shapes machine-readable. `ComponentMeta` gains an optional
  `typeDefs` field (`TypeDefMeta`/`TypeFieldMeta`) describing the fields of object props —
  the per-datum/per-series `color` override was previously only discoverable in prose, so
  AI/registry consumers filtering props by name never found it. `PieChart` and `BarChart`
  now declare `typeDefs` for `PieChartDatum`, `BarChartSeries`, `StackedRow`/`StackedSegment`,
  and the `ChartPoint` tooltip-callback argument; these flow into `registry.json`, the MCP
  `get_component` payload, and a new `## Object types` section in the generated `llms.txt`
  component docs. The `@cascivo/charts` README now documents coloring, donut center labels,
  and `toStackedSeries` row-pivot usage. Resolves the `@lifosy/ui` charts discoverability gap.
