# @cascivo/ai

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- d009502: Fixes for the 2026-08-14 adopter report (a Vercel-style dashboard on Vite +
  React Router).

  ## New: the vocabulary types are importable on the prebuilt path

  `Status.status` and `Badge.variant` are typed `ToneInput`, and every layout
  `gap` is a `SpaceStep` — but those types live in `@cascivo/core`, which is a
  _transitive_ dependency on the prebuilt path that the docs tell you not to
  install. So the first thing a typed dashboard writes had no supported import.

  ```ts
  import type { Tone } from '@cascivo/react/types'

  const DEPLOY_TONE: Record<DeployState, Tone> = {
    ready: 'success',
    error: 'danger',
  }
  ```

  `@cascivo/react/types` exports `Tone`, `ToneAlias`, `ToneInput`, `Progress`,
  `ProgressAlias`, `ProgressInput`, `SpaceStep` and `RovingOrientation`. On the
  copy-paste path keep importing from `@cascivo/core`. **Do not** add
  `@cascivo/core` to a prebuilt app to reach these — it is transitive there.

  They ship from a subpath rather than the main entry for a mechanical reason:
  component sources already import those names from core, so re-exporting them
  from `@cascivo/react` makes the dts bundler emit `ToneInput as ToneInput$1`
  and every prop switches to the aliased name.

  ## The router guide is now published

  `docs/USING-WITH-A-ROUTER.md` existed and was referenced from `Link`, `Tabs`
  and `setLinkComponent`, but was never published — so those pointers 404'd.
  It is now at <https://cascivo.com/docs/using-with-a-router.md> and in
  `npx @cascivo/docs`, along with three other guides that were also unpublished:
  `testing`, `css-layers-pitfall` and `third-party-css` (the last two cited by
  `@cascivo/react`'s own README and by `cascivo audit`).

  `setLinkComponent` gains a React Router recipe — its `to` is required, so the
  disabled-item case needs a fallback:

  ```tsx
  setLinkComponent(({ href, ...rest }: LinkComponentProps) => <Link to={href ?? '#'} {...rest} />)
  ```

  ## Components
  - `PageHeader.title` and `.description` accept `ReactNode`, not just `string`,
    so a page title can carry a status badge or a linked domain.
  - `CodeSnippet` accepts children as an alias for `code`
    (`<CodeSnippet>npm i foo</CodeSnippet>`). It stays a string — the content is
    tokenized for highlighting and handed to the clipboard.
  - `BreadcrumbItem` and `DockItem` gain the `id` escape hatch the other
    link-shaped item types already had. `Dock` previously keyed on the array
    index.
  - `Sparkline`'s documented default was 80 while the code applied 120; the docs
    now say 120 and that it is **fixed-width**, correcting a dashboard-recipe
    claim that it shrinks to fit.
  - `Stat` and `Kpi` now document the choice between them: `<Stat card>` matches
    `Kpi`'s chrome but **not** its layout, so pick one per app.
  - `label` visibility is now stated per component. It renders on screen for most
    components and is an invisible accessible name for a few (`Sparkline`,
    `Spinner`, `Fab`, …); nothing said which, and `<Toggle label>` duplicating a
    settings row's own heading is what the ambiguity cost.

  ## Charts

  `@cascivo/charts/styles.css` is **not** required on a bundler build — the entry
  imports its own stylesheet. It is required with no bundler, and on an SSR setup
  that externalises dependencies, where the CSS-free `node` twin loads. Several
  docs still called it unconditionally required. Also documents 13 chart and flow
  prop defaults that no generated table had ever shown.

  ## CLI
  - `cascivo create` emits the app shell as its own `src/Shell.tsx` with a
    `children` slot, so adding a router means deleting `App.tsx` and
    `src/sections/` rather than re-deriving the shell wiring.
  - The scaffold no longer imports the ~273 kB aggregate `@cascivo/react/styles.css`;
    per-component CSS auto-includes and tree-shakes on a bundler. A generated app
    now emits **39.65 kB** of entry CSS (6.90 kB gzip).
  - `create` inside an existing workspace detects the package manager from the
    surrounding lock file instead of always reporting npm under `npx`.
  - The browser tab title is title-cased rather than the raw directory name.

### Patch Changes

- 00b74e9: Run the release train so the stranded 0.17.0 reaches npm and the recovery path
  gets exercised on a real release.

  No package source changed in this PR — the fixes are the Tag visual baselines
  and `release.yml`'s new `Publish any stranded versions` step. But `release.yml`
  only triggers on pushes that touch `.changeset/**`, so without a changeset
  merging it would not start a release at all, and the step meant to unstrand
  0.17.0 would sit unverified until some unrelated changeset happened to land.

  Bumping the whole published set matches the 2026-08-11 changeset it lands
  beside: npm is behind `main` on every package, not just the ones whose source
  moved, and a partial bump would leave the rest still disagreeing.

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- 3fcf3f1: Bump every published package so the next release run publishes the whole set.

  The 0.17.0 bump landed on `main` but never reached npm: the release job's build
  died inside `changesets/action` with `Failed to spawn process: Resource
temporarily unavailable (os error 11)` — an `EAGAIN` write to that action's
  stdout pipe, not a build failure. This changeset re-cuts the whole set on top of
  the workflow fix, so every package publishes from a release that runs its build
  in a runner-owned step.

## 0.16.0

### Patch Changes

- dc2d9e7: Add `@cascivo/core/pure`, and stop stamping `'use client'` on every `@cascivo/react` chunk.

  `@cascivo/react` previously applied a blanket `'use client'` banner to **every** emitted
  chunk, and hardcoded it into both flat entries. All 272 chunks carried it, `badge.js`
  included, and `dist/index.js` was `'use client'; export * from …` — so
  `import { Badge } from '@cascivo/react'` inside a Server Component crossed a client boundary
  at the barrel, no matter what the source said. The banner is now gone and the entries are
  bare re-exports: 86 of 272 chunks carry the directive, and the components that need no
  client JS render on the server without hydrating.

  That change was attempted once and reverted, because removing the banner broke RSC
  prerendering outright:

  ```
  Attempted to call cn() from the server but cn is on the client.
  ```

  `@cascivo/core` builds as a **single bundled chunk** whose own `'use client'` banner is
  load-bearing — the bundler collapses its 23 directive-carrying modules into one file and
  drops their per-module directives, so without it Next.js treats every hook and
  `Portal`/`Presence` as a Server Component. The side effect is that _everything_ in
  `@cascivo/core` sits behind a client boundary, including helpers that need no browser at all.

  **`@cascivo/core/pure`** is the fix: the same sources built without the banner, exporting
  exactly the transitively-pure surface — `cn`, `composeRefs`, `mergeProps`, `Slot`,
  `normalizeTone`, `normalizeProgress`, `sentimentOf`, `useId`, and their types. The subpath is
  small because it was measured, not guessed: the components that need it import only a
  handful of distinct symbols between them.

  ```tsx
  import { cn, Slot, normalizeTone } from '@cascivo/core/pure'
  ```

  **Nothing existing breaks.** `@cascivo/core` still exports every one of these, so client
  components keep their single import and no API is removed. Reach for `/pure` only from a
  component that must render on the server — exactly the set `clientJs: 'none'` names.
  **Type-only imports never need it**: they are erased at compile time, so they create no
  runtime edge, and routing a type through both specifiers makes the published `.d.ts` alias it.

  `packages/core`'s banner is untouched and must stay. Only `@cascivo/react`'s was redundant,
  because `preserveModules` keeps its chunks one-to-one with sources.

  `@cascivo/charts`, `@cascivo/flow`, `@cascivo/editor` and `@cascivo/ai` get subpath-aware
  externals (`/^@cascivo\/core($|\/)/` instead of the exact string). An exact string does not
  match `@cascivo/core/pure`, which silently bundles a second copy of `cn`/`Slot` into each
  package and duplicates their types in the published declarations — the same class of bug
  `@cascivo/core`'s own externals comment already warned about.

- 97da94e: Repair the two CI gates failing on `main`, and refresh the generated registry artifacts.

  No package's runtime code changes here — every bump in this release is version-only.

  **`drift`** — `clientJs` reached the component manifests, but the 103 generated
  per-component files under `apps/site/public/r/` came from a branch cut before it, so merging
  the two left every one of them a field short. Regenerated; no other artifact moved.

  **`verify`** — `isolated:check`, the canary that type-checks packed tarballs in a strict,
  non-hoisted consumer workspace, was dying in `pnpm install` rather than in the type check it
  exists to run:

  ```
  ERR_PNPM_NO_MATCHING_VERSION  No matching version found for
  @cascivo/core@^0.15.0 while fetching it from https://registry.npmjs.org/
  ```

  `pnpm pack` rewrites `workspace:^` to `^<version>`, so the packed `@cascivo/react` asked the
  registry for a version that does not exist until release day — the fixture broke on every
  version bump that landed ahead of a publish, which is exactly what happened. Every
  inter-cascivo edge is now pinned to the tarball built from the commit under test, via
  `overrides` in the fixture's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. The location matters: pnpm 10+ no longer
  reads the `pnpm` field from `package.json` and only warns about it, so the `pnpm.overrides`
  spelling silently does nothing.

  That also closes a quieter hole. Even when the versions did resolve, the fixture type-checked
  the freshly-built `@cascivo/react` against the last **published** `@cascivo/core` rather than
  the one just built — a mix, not the build under test.

  A new guard fails the fixture if any `@cascivo/*` dependency falls outside its `PACKAGES`
  list, since such an edge would slip back to registry resolution unnoticed — the silent-skip
  failure mode a canary must never have.

- 4172611: Bump every published package so the next release run publishes the whole set. The

  older than the rest of the workspace. This changeset gives each of them a real new
  version, keeping the published set in lockstep.

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 0b6b44e: Force a version bump across every published package to verify the changesets
  publish patch fix (see the release workflow fix in PR #168): several packages
  had been stuck re-publishing their already-released version on every release
  run and failing with a spurious E403, because the "already published" error
  detection missed pnpm's actual error shape. This changeset gives every
  package a real new version so the next release run exercises a genuine
  publish for all of them, not just the ones with substantive changes.

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- 21e7ddb: Raise the `@preact/signals-react` peer floor from `>=2.0.0` to `>=3.0.0`.

  React 19 removed the internal export that signals-react 2.x imports, so a 2.x
  runtime fails to load under React 19 (`SyntaxError: … '__SECRET_INTERNALS…'`). The
  old `>=2` floor let a resolver pick that broken build. signals-react 3.x still
  supports React 16.14+/17/18, so the new floor costs React-18 users nothing.

  If a lockfile carried over from an earlier install pins signals-react 2.x, run
  `cascivo doctor` — it now flags the mismatch (error on React 19, warning on React 18)
  with the exact upgrade command.

### Patch Changes

- 958fd6f: Every published package now exports `./package.json`, so
  `require.resolve('@cascivo/<pkg>/package.json')` resolves instead of throwing
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. Previously only `@cascivo/react` exposed it, which
  tripped version probes, bundler plugins, and inspection tooling on the other packages.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5bafdb6: AI-layer delivery (audit wave 3):

  - `@cascivo/mcp` is self-contained: `tokens.catalog.json`, `context.json`, per-component `context/*.md`, `tokens.variants.json`, and `marketplace.json` are bundled into the published package, so `get_tokens`, `get_context`, `get_variant_matrix`, `validate_component`, `list_templates`, and `get_template` all work offline via `npx -y @cascivo/mcp` (previously `list_templates`/`get_template` silently returned an empty catalog for every external user, and the token/context tools required network access).
  - The marketplace catalog loader now falls back to the hosted copy and reports an explicit error when neither is available, instead of silently returning an empty catalog.
  - `get_component` responses include `version`, `files`, and per-file `fileHashes`, letting agents detect drift between installed copies and upstream.
  - One canonical artifact-host constant per package (`CASCIVO_HOST`) replaces scattered `cascivo.com` literals.
  - `@cascivo/ai` (StreamingText, AiLabel, Terminal, AiChat) is published for the first time — it was advertised in the README but marked private. First publish requires the trusted-publisher bootstrap in docs/RELEASING.md.
