"""Measured class kerning.

Which pairs: src/kern_candidates.json, the character pairs that two independently kerned fonts
(Geist and Inter) both kern in the same direction, plus the pairs first chosen by hand (see
kern_oracle.py). Only the list is borrowed. Every value is measured here from Cascivo's own
outlines, in every master, and a candidate is dropped when that measurement disagrees in sign
or is too small to see. Measuring every possible pair instead "works" numerically but kerns
open shapes the eye already accepts (it once tightened LM and FG).

How much: the gap between the first glyph's right profile and the second glyph's left profile
is measured in 10-unit bands, depth-limited (a deep hole only counts so much, as for the eye),
and compared with the gap between two straight stems. Two more terms: the closest point, and how
far both facing sides lean the same way (parallel diagonals, as in AV or Av, read looser than
their gap says). The weights were fitted by least squares on 70% of the candidates so that,
applied to Cascivo's own outlines, the result best matches the Geist/Inter average. On the
held-out 30% it is off by 15 units on average with correlation 0.61; Geist and Inter differ from
each other by 21 (correlation 0.45). It undershoots the strongest pairs (about -56 where the
references use -78), which errs toward loose rather than colliding.
